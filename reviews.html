            <h4>Reviews</h4>
            <p class="review">
                Kathy is so kind, friendly and trustworthy. She was happy to come round and meet our
                cat Happy before we went away over Christmas. She had some great suggestions for
                Happy like leaving a little hot water bottle for him under his bed and leaving
                treats around the flat for him to find whilst we were away. She was very easy to
                communicate with so we were assured that Happy would be well looked after. She also
                refreshed his litter tray while we were away and was happy to turn lights on and
                off. Whilst we were away, she kept us updated regularly with texts about how he was!
                When we returned home, Happy was all snuggled up in his usual spot and came out to
                see us happily. He is usually a pretty nervous cat around strangers but Kathy said
                that on one of her visits he came out and ate his dinner whilst she was in the
                room!! We would definitely recommend Kathy's cat sitting services! Very pleased.</p>

            <p>Kathy walked our dog Ethel while we were on holiday for two weeks and treated her
                as one of her own. The love she has for dogs of all breeds is easy to see and
                she also knows how to get them to stick to the rules! Ethel made best mates with
                Kathyâ€™s dog Tara while we were away and we would have no hesitations to book her
                again..</p>

            <p>I have been extremely pleased with the Waggles and Whiskers service. Kathy was
                very
                friendly and took such good care of my dog ! He seemed tired out and well looked
                after ! Much better than other dog walking services I have used I will
                definitely be
                continuing with waggles and whiskers. Thank You!</p>

            <p>Kathy has been walking my Daschund Colin for the past 18 months. Kathy is
                fantastic, she is kind and caring and has managed to help Colin overcome his
                fear of bicycles with her patient approach. I would definitely recommend
                Kathy.</p>

            <p>Kathy has always taken excellent care of my dog and I know he's always in great
                hands with her, he's so excited each time he sees her. She has a wonderful
                approach with him and the group walks means he gets to play and have a great run
                around. I'd definitely recommend Waggles & Whiskers to anyone with a dog or
                other pet! A friendly, personal and lovely service.</p>
